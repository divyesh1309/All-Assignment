Q 2. Write a basic media query that adjusts the font size of a webpage for screens smaller than 600px. 

@media only screen and (max-width: 600px) {
    body {
        font-size: 14px;
    }
}


-> This media query @media only screen and (max-width: 600px) ensures that the styles inside it apply only to screens with a maximum width of 600px. This is commonly used for mobile devices, making the webpage responsive and adaptable to smaller screens.

-> Inside this query, body { font-size: 14px; } changes the font size of the webpage to 14px for devices with a screen width of 600px or smaller.
