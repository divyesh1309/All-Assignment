Q 1. What are media queries in CSS, and why are they important for responsive design?

What are media queries in CSS ?

-> Media queries in CSS allow web pages to adapt to different screen sizes and devices by applying specific styles based on conditions like screen width, height, resolution, or device type. They help create responsive designs that look good on desktops, tablets, and mobile phones.


Why are they important for responsive design?

-> Ensures websites adjust to different screen sizes (desktops, tablets, and mobiles).
-> Makes content readable and accessible without zooming or unnecessary scrolling.
-> Google favors mobile-friendly websites, leading to better search rankings.
-> Ensures elements like navigation menus, images, and text adjust properly.


Example :- 

@media (max-width: 768px) {
  body {
    background-color: lightblue;
  }
}

A screen width of 768px or smaller typically refers to tablets and mobile devices.
