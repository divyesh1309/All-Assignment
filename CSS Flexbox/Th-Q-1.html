Q 1. What is CSS Flexbox, and how is it useful for layout design? Explain the terms flex-container and flex-item 

1. What is CSS Flexbox ? 

-> CSS Flexbox (Flexible Box Layout) is a layout model designed to efficiently arrange, align, and distribute space among elements within a container, even when their sizes are unknown or dynamic.

-> It is particularly useful for responsive design, as it allows elements to adjust their size and position based on available space.



2. How is it useful for layout design ? 

-> It allows effortless alignment of items both horizontally (row) and vertically (column) without complex CSS positioning.

-> It ensures equal or proportional spacing by using properties like justify-content for horizontal alignment and align-items for vertical alignment.

-> Flexbox also enables automatic resizing, where elements adjust based on available space, reducing the need for media queries


3. flex-container and flex-item  

1) Flex-container :- A Flex Container is the parent element that holds and controls flex items.
                  -> It is created using ( display: flex; or display: inline-flex; ).
                  -> display: flex; - Defines the element as a flex container.
                  -> flex-direction - Sets the main axis direction (row, column).
                  -> justify-content - Aligns items horizontally (e.g., center, space-between).
                  -> align-items - Aligns items vertically (e.g., center, stretch).
                  -> flex-wrap - Controls whether items should wrap to the next line.


2) Flex-item :- Flex Items are the child elements inside a flex container. These items adjust their size, position, and alignment based on the flex properties applied to them.

                 -> flex-grow - Defines how much an item should grow relative to others.
                 -> flex-shrink - Controls how items shrink when space is limited.
                 -> flex-basis - Sets the initial size of the flex item.
                 -> align-self - Aligns an individual item within the flex container.
 

Example :- 

.container 
{
  display: flex;  
  justify-content: space-between;  
  align-items: center; 
}

.item 
{
  flex: 1;  
}
