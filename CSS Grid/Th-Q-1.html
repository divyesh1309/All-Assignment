Q 1. Explain CSS Grid and how it differs from Flexbox. When would you use Grid over Flexbox?
 

1) What is CSS Grid ?

-> CSS Grid is a powerful layout system designed for creating two-dimensional layouts (both rows and columns). It helps in placing elements exactly where you want them within a grid structure.

Example :- 
.container 
{
  display: grid;
  grid-template-columns: 1fr 2fr 1fr; 
  grid-template-rows: auto auto;
  gap: 10px; 
}



2) Differenc from Flexbox and CSS Grid

-> CSS Grid is a two-dimensional system that controls both rows and columns, whereas Flexbox is a one-dimensional system that works along either a row or column.

-> CSS Grid is ideal for structured layouts like webpages, dashboards, and galleries, while Flexbox is best for dynamic layouts like navbars, buttons, and centering elements.

-> CSS Grid allows items to overlap or be positioned precisely using properties like grid-area, whereas Flexbox items adjust dynamically based on available space and can wrap when needed.



3) When to Use CSS Grid Over Flexbox?

=>> CSS Grid 

-> You are designing a full webpage layout with multiple sections.
-> You need both horizontal and vertical alignment at the same time.
-> You want elements to overlap or be positioned freely within a grid.

=>> Flexbox 

-> You need a simple one-dimensional layout either row or column.
-> You want dynamic alignment and spacing (Ex. navbars, buttons)
-> Your elements should resize automatically based on content.
