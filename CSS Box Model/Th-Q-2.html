Q 2. What is the difference between border-box and content-box box-sizing in CSS? Which is the default? 

-> The box-sizing property in CSS controls how the total width and height of an element are calculated.

Difference between Border-box and Content-box 

1. Border-box :- 

-> The border-box value in CSS box-sizing ensures that an element's total width and height include its content, padding, and border.

-> In border-box, padding and border are included inside the specified width and height.

Example :- 

div 
{
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  box-sizing: border-box;
}

----------------------

2. Content-box :- 

-> The content-box value in CSS box-sizing means that the specified width and height apply only to the content.

-> padding and border are added outside the content, increasing the total size of the element.

-> content-box is the default box-sizing value in CSS. It requires extra calculations when adding padding and borders.

Examole :- 

div 
{
  width: 200px;
  padding: 20px;
  border: 5px solid black;
  box-sizing: content-box; /* Default */
}
