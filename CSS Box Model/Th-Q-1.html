Q 1. Explain the CSS box model and its components (content, padding, border, margin). How does each affect the size of an element? 

-> The CSS Box Model is a concept that defines the size of any HTML element, consisting of content, padding, border, and margin.

1. Content :- 

-> This is the innermost part of the box where the actual text, images, or other content of the element is placed. The width and height properties define the dimensions of this content area.



2. Padding :- 

-> Padding is the space between the content and the border. It increases the total size of the element without affecting the border. It is used to create space around the content and is defined by the padding property.

Example :- padding: 10px;



3. Border :- 

-> A line that surrounds the padding and content is defined by the border property. It can have different styles (solid, dashed, dotted), colors, and widths.

Example :- border: 2px solid black;



4. Margin :- 

-> The margin is the outermost space that separates the element from other elements. It does not affect the element’s actual size but determines spacing around it. is defined by the margin property.

Example :- margin: 15px;



How does each affect the size of an element?  

-> By default, the width and height properties in CSS only apply to the content area. However, if you use box-sizing: border-box;, the padding and border are included in the element's width and height, preventing them from expanding the overall size.
