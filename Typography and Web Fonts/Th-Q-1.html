Q 1. Explain the difference between web-safe fonts and custom web fonts. Why might you use a web-safe font over a custom font?

1) Web-safe fonts :-

-> Web-Safe Fonts are fonts that are pre-installed on most operating systems and devices, ensuring that text appears consistently across different browsers without requiring additional downloads.


Example :- 

-> Arial (sans-serif)
-> Verdana (sans-serif)
-> Tahoma (sans-serif)
-> Trebuchet MS (sans-serif)
-> Times New Roman (serif)
-> Georgia (serif)
-> Garamond (serif)


2) Custom web fonts :- 

-> Custom Web Fonts are fonts that are not pre-installed on devices and need to be loaded from the web using services like Google Fonts, Adobe Fonts, or self-hosted font files.

Example :- 

ans-Serif Fonts :- Roboto, Open Sans, Lato, Montserrat, Poppins
Serif Fonts :- Merriweather, Playfair Display, Lora
Monospace Fonts :- Fira Code, Source Code Pro, Space Mono
Cursive Fonts :- Dancing Script, Pacifico
Display Fonts :- Bebas Neue, Oswald, Raleway



Why Use a Web-Safe Font Over a Custom Font? 

-> Faster Loading :- No extra file download, improving page speed.
-> Better Compatibility :- Works on almost all devices without issues.
-> SEO & Performance :- Reduces page load time, improving user experience and SEO ranking.
-> Reliability :- No risk of fonts failing to load due to internet issues.
