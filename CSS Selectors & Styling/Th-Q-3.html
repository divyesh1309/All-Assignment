Q 3. What is the difference between internal, external, and inline CSS? Discuss the advantages and disadvantages of each approach.

Ans :-

CSS can be applied to HTML in three different ways Inline CSS, Internal CSS, and External CSS.

1) Inline CSS :- Inline CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML element.

advantages of Inline CSS :-

-> It is easy to apply and can be used to quickly style individual elements.
-> It has the highest specificity and will override other CSS styles.
-> It is useful for quick prototyping or testing styles.

disadvantages of Inline CSS :-

-> It can make the HTML code less readable and harder to maintain.
-> It can be difficult to update styles across multiple elements.
-> Writing styles repeatedly for multiple elements increases development time and makes debugging more difficult.


------------------------------------------


2) Internal CSS :- Internal CSS is used to apply a unique style to a single HTML page.

advantages of Internal CSS :-

-> It allows you to apply styles to multiple elements on a single page.
-> It is easier to maintain and update styles across multiple elements.
-> It keeps the styles separate from the HTML content, making the code more readable.

disadvantages of Internal CSS :-

-> If you need to apply the same styles across multiple pages, you would need to duplicate the styles on every page, which can become cumbersome.
->  Internal CSS is not suitable for complex websites because managing styles within multiple HTML files can become difficult and unorganized.
-> Every time the page is loaded, the browser has to read and process the internal styles, which can slow down performance, especially if there is a large amount of CSS.


------------------------------------------


3) External CSS :- External CSS is used to apply styles to multiple HTML pages.

advantages of External CSS :-

-> It allows you to apply styles across multiple pages, making it easier to maintain and update styles.
-> Browsers cache external CSS files, so once the CSS is loaded, it does not need to be reloaded for every page, improving website performance.
-> You can update the design of an entire website by modifying just one CSS file, rather than editing styles in multiple HTML files.


disadvantages of External CSS :-

-> If the external stylesheet is missing or linked incorrectly, the webpage will not display the intended styles.
-> If the CSS file fails to load due to a network issue, the webpage may appear unstyled or broken.
-> External CSS files can increase the number of HTTP requests, which can slow down page load times, especially if there are multiple CSS files being loaded.

----

overall, the best approach is to use external CSS for larger websites with multiple pages, internal CSS for single-page websites, and inline CSS for quick prototyping or testing styles.
