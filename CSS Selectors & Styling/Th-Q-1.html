        text-align: center;
        color: red;
    }


-> Class Selector :- class selector choose the one or more elements based on the class name.

Example :- 

    .header
    {
        margin: 0;
        padding: 0;
        background-color: lightblue;
    }


-> ID Selector :- ID selector is used to style only one specific element using its ID name. ID must always be unique and should not be the same for multiple elements.


Example :- 

    #content

        width: 100%;
        background-color: blue;
        color: white;
    }
